Responsiveness Analysis

Why?

The answer is simple. It’s no longer enough to design for a single device. Mobile web traffic has overtaken desktop and now makes up the majority of website traffic, accounting for more than 51%.
When over half of your potential visitors are using a mobile device to browse the internet, you can’t just serve them a page designed for desktop. It would be hard to read and use, and lead to bad user experience.

Responsive vs Adaptive

The difference between responsive design and adaptive design is that responsive design adapts the rendering of a single page version. In contrast, adaptive design delivers multiple completely different versions of the same page.


Fluid Layouts

A fluid layout is an essential part of modern responsive design. In the good old days, you would set a static value for every HTML element, like 600 pixels. A fluid layout relies instead on dynamic values like a percentage of the viewport width.


How to Make Your Website Responsive

Set Your Media Query Ranges (Responsive Breakpoints)

Set your media query ranges based on the unique needs of your design. For example, if we wanted to follow the Bootstrap standards for our design, we would use the following media queries:

2560px
1440px 
1024px
768px
425px
375px
320px




2. Size Layout Elements with Percentages. (Fluid Layouts)

The first and most important step is to set up different sizes for different layout elements depending on the media query or screen breakpoint. The number of layout containers you have will depend on the design.


3. Implement Responsive Images

One way to make sure that your images don’t break is merely using a dynamic value for all pictures, as we covered earlier.


4. Responsive Typography For Your Website Text

The main focus of responsive web design is on the responsiveness of the layout blocks, elements, and media. Text is often treated as an afterthought.
But for a truly responsive design, you should also adjust your font-sizes, font-weights, line-height appropriately to match screen size.
The easiest way to do so is to set a static value for font-size, like 22 px, and adapt it in each media query.
